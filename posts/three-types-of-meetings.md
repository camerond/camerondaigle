I have a system – a survival mechanism, really – for classifying, planning, and
executing meetings in a way that helps keep me sane at work. I've shared it with
enough folks for whom it was also a survival mechanism that it's now a system,
at a URL, for you.

### You can't solve meetings by just adding or subtracting them.

Managers generally feel more effective when they're communicating directly with
people, which means they tend to be fans of meetings, so they try to solve issues
with meetings through _other_ meetings.

Individual contributors, however, generally feel more
effective when they're plying their trade. So they tend to feel pulled away from
their 'real work' when they have to attend meetings, and so they try to solve issues
with meetings by cutting down on meetings, or just checking out while in meetings.

### Not more, not less – just better.

As a warning, this system isn't necessarily a path to having _fewer_ meetings. After
all, everyone's threshold for 'too many meetings' is different based on what
helps them feel effective at their role, and every company's need for meetings
is dependent upon the work they're trying to accomplish.

There's even a possibility that once you've worked through this system, you end up
with _more_ meetings, because you've realized you need to break apart one monstrous, all-encompassing meeting
that's trying to do too many things.

I'm hoping this system helps you have _better_ meetings – that the people
running the meeting feel like it's worth their time to run them, and that the
people in attendance feel like their presence there _matters_.

### Here's the system.

I believe all meetings can either be defined as either **Status**
meetings, **Feedback** meetings, or **Decision** meetings.

As I explain each type, I'll talk about them via 4 aspects:

- **The goal.** Having a clear idea of what each meeting type is trying to
  accomplish is the first and best way for us to know when it's a Good Meeting.
  (Yes, meetings can be Good!)
- **The scale.** All meetings don't work for all audience sizes – having an
  understanding of scale will help you know who to invite to what.
- **The power dynamic.** There is _always_ a power dynamic at play in any
  meeting; you need to understand what it is in order for it to be constructive
  instead of destructive to the execution of the meeting.
- **The risks.** As you'll soon see, each of these meeting types can devolve into either
  a bad version of itself or literally another type of meeting if it's run
  poorly. There's even an infographic at the end, if you're patient (or
  impatient and willing to scroll a lot).

## Status Meetings

Let's start with what the most common meeting type on most peoples' calendar: the status
meeting. Maybe your company has weekly readouts, or daily standups. Maybe
there's a quarterly all-hands, or a monthly report. Most meetings, for better or
worse, are status meetings, even when they shouldn't be (we'll get to that).

### Status Meetings: The Goal

The goal of a status meeting should be simply to **disseminate information**.
That's it. If the attendees of the meeting come away with current and relevant
information about whatever the hell the meeting was intending to communicate,
it's done its job.

### Status Meetings: The Scale

The scale of a status meeting can essentially be infinite. Hell, the State of
the Union address is basically a nationwide status meeting. Go nuts, as long as
your material is relevant to your audience. If it's not, you're just wasting
valuable audience (and presenter) time and energy.

### Status Meetings: The Power Dynamic

The power dynamic of a healthy status meeting is actually very straightforward:

**The presenter has the power**.

That's it. In a morning squad standup (the most equitable status meeting), the
person speaking is the presenter, and has the power. Even if the presenter is
presenting to the executive team, they should _still_ have the power in the
meeting.

### Status Meetings: Devolution

Because the goal of a status meeting is so simple, and the scale can be so
large, the risks of an individual status meeting can seem relatively benign,
especially because the bigger a meeting is, the less often it occurs (e.g. a
quarterly all-hands can be pretty boring, but at least it's only boring 4 times a year).

But the erosion of morale from bad status meetings doesn't happen because _one_
of them is bad, it happens because _many_ of them are bad.

Often when people feel like they're drowning in meetings, it's because they're
having to navigate too many status meetings – meetings where they're just in the audience
audience, just listening, just waiting to get back to their "real work" as it
were. Or they're having to present, which can be equally draining – reading out
information, likely over and over, as the audience or the information changes
slightly from meeting to meeting.

#### Status meetings should be **efficient**, **structured**, and **read-only**.

A status meeting that isn't **efficient** probably just needs to be shorter –
even if that means it happens more often. Is your Product Team Monthly a two-hour
slog? Maybe it could be a sprightly _one_-hour slog, with more info in a followup document. Maybe
it could be a trim 30 minutes biweekly. Hell, maybe it could be an email.

A status meeting that isn't **structured** is probably inefficient. Different
ceremonies for different types of status meetings can really help – make sure
you have a running agenda, or a slide deck, or minutes. The most well-loved
meeting at my company is something called Design Lightning, where designers all
contribute 1-2 slides of current to a deck, which a facilitator then keys
through as each designer spends 1-2 minutes explaining their work. Snappy,
structured, usually over in under 30 minutes, with folks feeling informed and
inspired.

A status meeting that isn't **read-only** runs the biggest risk of all, because
once interruptions happen and the conversation commences that
the presenter/speaker has to navigate on the fly, the power of the speaker is no
longer respected, and well, buddy, you're not in a
status meeting anymore.

Your carefully-constructed status meeting **has devolved
into a Surprise Feedback Meeting**.

(As you'll see, each of these meeting types can devolve into one of the others, which is kind of
fun. I'll have a cute graphic at the end here, so you can keep reading, or just
cheat and scroll down, I won't mind.)

## Feedback Meetings

You might feel like the "read-only" rule I'm pushing for Status Meetings feels
unnecessarily restrictive. What if people have things to say? What if _you_ have
things to say? Look, I understand. You probably do have things to say. They're
probably important and awesome! But as with all awesome and important things,
they deserve to matter. Catching a presenter off-guard mid-slide isn't going to
be the optimal way for them to recieve your challenge, inquiry, or insight. To
really set everyone up for productive dialogue, you need a feedback meeting.

### Feedback Meetings: The Goal

The goal of a feedback meeting is **for a specific person or group of people to
get the information they need about their work**. If the person who needs that
information gets it, the meeting is a success.

### Feedback Meetings: The Scale

Feedback meetings are very tricky to scale – too few people and you may be
excluding important voices in terms of expertise, perspective, or diversity, but
too many, and people may leave feeling unheard, or the conversation may become
unwieldy.

It can be a good idea to scope a feedback meeting to an entire team (for
example, we have a weekly Design Crit to which all designers are invited) or
some other easy-to-grok rationale, and then make sure the meeting presenter or
facilitator is proactively making sure everyone is heard.

### Feedback Meetings: The Power Dynamic

If you've scaled your audience properly, everyone involved has expertise, domain
knowledge, and input ready to deploy when the moment is right – but sometimes
you're just presenting to management or leadership.

Often, the person asking for feedback does _not_ hold the power in the room.

Say you have a monthly review with your leadership team. This meeting might
even be _called_ a Monthly Status Meeting, but it's likely not a Status Meeting by this
system, because you often get _feedback_ in the form of inquiries,
approval/disapproval, or simply gut reactions to the work you're presenting.

This dynamic exists even at smaller scales. For example, imagine a designer
simply presenting their designs to other designers on the team in a weekly
critique call. If one of those colleagues holds more sway due to status,
seniority, or even just privilege, the presenter may have to really fight the
temptation to devolve the meeting into a Decision Meeting (which we'll examine
in the next section).

Conversely, let's picture a situation where your company made a structural
change and is now hosting a Q&A session about it. In that case, the leadership
again holds the power, but is now inviting feedback.

Power tends to be empowered by the status quo, so company leadership isn't that
likely to switch tactics midstream – they're probably not at risk of suddenly
devolving the meeting in the same way. Their challenge is instead to be aware of the power
they hold as a presenter and focus on making the feedback meeting rewarding and
relevant to the people providing that feedback.

For example, this might look like _not_ trying to respond to feedback in the
moment, but instead listening to the feedback, taking notes, and providing
considered answers in a followup readout (a status meeting!) or written recap.

### Feedback Meetings: Devolution

Because the power imbalance and the stakes can be fairly high in a
feedback meeting, there are many pitfalls to watch out for.

One is simply that feedback itself can spin out of control. Entire
other articles and columns and books have been written just about how to
compose, deliver, and recieve contructive feedback; I can't do that here, this
page is long enough as it is. In this context, let's instead
focus on the meeting itself and two big risks you need to navigate:

**Make and keep strong boundaries as a presenter.**

The presenter simply needs to collect relevant information so they
can step away after the meeting, weigh and consider it, and move forward from there. It's in their
best interest to define the playing field for that information as clearly as
possible.

For example, instead of a generic 'what do you think?', they could be open about being unsure
about their wording choice, or their color choice, or whether the overall
structure of their work makes sense. Clear boundaries help the audience know
what to focus on and understand what's in play for discussion.

Here's the second risk, which I think is the most crucial:

**Don't make any decisions.**

The moment the presenter stops _recieving_ feedback and starts _reacting_ to it,
you're in trouble.

In my world (product design), this looks like a product designer suddenly
whipping open Figma and doing a little "how about now?" dance mid-meeting.  Even
if that designer is _awesome_ and the feedback they're getting is _perfect_,
they're eating up everyone else's time, who now have to wait their turn as
pixels get pushed around, or join into the ad-hoc design session, which is now
at risk of being incredibly messy.

Dialogue is fine! Conversations are great. Feedback should be recieved, recorded
and followed up on. But once you start _deciding_ things – whether you're moving
a mockup around or just tweaking a slide or a document, you've now **devolved** your
feedback meeting into a **Bad Feedback Meeting That's Actually A Surprise
Decision Meeting.**

This devolution is often unintentional and the result of an unrecognized power
dynamic. Keeping a feedback meeting from devolving requires the powerful voices
in the room to stay aware of the power they wield when they speak up, and
requires them to make sure the presenter feels _safe_ to simply _receive_ even
the most incisive, earthshaking feedback.

## Decision Meetings

Much like the Status Meeting might feel restrictive to the person looking to have
their voice heard in a meeting, the Feedback Meeting might feel like it's
limiting your ability to Actually Do Something. So let's talk about Decision
Meetings, which exist specifically to fill that need.

### Decision Meetings: The Goal

The goal of a decision meeting is to **present one or more problems and make a
decision about them**.

Sounds easy, but it's not, especially since people don't often identify decision
meetings very well! In my experience these meetings are the rarest in terms of
quantity, for two main reasons:

#### Decisions often don't get their own meetings.

In their absence, decisions tend to get made through less-healthy means – like
somewhere inside a chaotic Feedback Meeting, or silently by someone just making
a call so they can keep moving, or in a 1:1 between two people that are tired of
waiting.

#### Decision meetings are often misidentified.

Here are some examples of meetings that are actually decision meetings:

- Your team gets together Monday to make sure everyone has work to do that week.
  This might masquerade as "Monday Sync", but it's not a Status Meeting, because
  you're deciding together what everyone is working on.
- Your team runs 2-week sprints and has a Session Planning meeting. Yeah, that's
  a decision meeting. Actually most planning meetings are decision meetings.
- Your team has a monthly backlog grooming session. Yep, that's decision time,
  baby.

### Decision Meetings: The Scale

Decision meetings should be your smallest type of meeting. Everyone should be a
stakeholder and participant in the work being done, and should take an
active role in the process of producing said decision(s).

If the meeting is too small, you're risking "why wasn't I consulted"-type
messages later. If it's too big, you're risking folks not feeling like their
voice is heard, or simply giving them more meeting fatigue when they could be
doing something else.

### Decision Meetings: The Power Dynamic

Decision meetings are one place where the existing power dynamic is actually a
key aspect of the meeting's success rather than something that you need to watch
out for.

(To be clear, when I say "power" here, I specifically mean power in terms of
professional role definition, not forms of privilege that exhibit as power. The
senior represenative, or manager, or director, not simply the loudest person or
the one who's been around the longest.)

I simply mean that someone needs to be **accountable** for the decision that's
being made. In a company dynamic with healthy roles and responsibilities, that
means the most powerful person in the room is responsible – for taking notes,
facilitating discussion, including everyone's voice, and producing not only the
decision, but notes & information that contextualize it for anyone that needs
the paper trail later.

### Decision Meetings: Devolution

Here's your devolution point, which points us right back to our first meeting
type:  If your decision meeting ends without a decision, congrats, you've just
experienced an Unsatisfying Status Meeting.

Decision meetings may be the rarest type of _explicitly_ defined meetings, but
"syncs" or "alignment" meetings (decision meetings) that don't reach a decision
point (bad status meetings) are probably the _most_ common meeting to glut your
calendar, and wear you out.

It's also possible that, while a decision wasn't made, someone gave some
feedback that led someone else to go back and adjust something afterward, which
means they were just subject to a Stressful Feedback Meeting. But even in this
case where the meeting _did_ affect some amount of change, you sure as hell
didn't get a _decision made together_ in a way that helps the team feel
satisfied, empowered, and focused.
