        # About Cameron Daigle

        I'm the creative director at [Hashrocket](http://hashrocket.com) in sunny Jacksonville, Florida. I have a wife and son whom I love with all of my heart. I once reclined on a concrete rhinoceros somewhere near a Dakota.

        Our design team at Hashrocket works alongside a crack team of Ruby on Rails and iOS developers who practice [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development). We take pride in matching their agile backend development with equally agile design and frontend development.

        I specialize in encouraging and honing clients’ ideas and goals – and then putting them into motion.

        ## Social bits

        - I write code on [Github](http://github.com/camerond)
        - I post design snippets to [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/cameron)
        - I track my music-listening habits at [Last FM](http://www.last.fm/user/camerondaigle)
        - I take pictures with my telephone and put them on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/camerondaigle)
        - I am "Elite" on [Yelp](http://camerondaigle.yelp.com) for some reason or another

        # Other Projects

        I lovingly post photography at [This Town Will Eat You](http://thistownwilleatyou.tumblr.com).

        I have a couple of tiny jQuery plugins that sprouted out of some project needs:

        - [jQuery.minical](http://jquery-minical.heroku.com), an lightweight datepicker
        - [jQuery.graphie](http://jquery-graphie.heroku.com), a little graphing library

        I'm responsible for the waste of figurative space that is [text-align: centaur](http://textaligncentaur.com/).

        # For Your Knowledge & Benefit

        I feel that I should clarify something that Google may attempt to obfuscate: while my name is fairly unique and Googleable, there are a couple of other Cameron Daigles in the world.

        For the record, I do not write poetry online (or otherwise), nor do I post YouTube videos of my George W. Bush impressions. Lastly, if you happen upon a video of Cameron Daigle getting hit in the face by an exercise machine, that is also not me. Thank you for your time.
